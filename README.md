# User Experience
### User Stories
### Strategy
<!-- Project goals, customer goals, company goals -->
The goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access, short and an informative B2C based site, while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.
### Scope
<!--Features to include based on strategy (can/cannot achieve) -->
### Structure
<!--How the information will be logically grouped on the the site -->
#### <em>Website Sections:</em>
1. Home/landing page
2. About
3. Services
4. Contact
5. Footer
#### <em>Website Flow</em>
The flow of the site is simple and makes the logical linear progression from : About Us --> services --> Contact us.
The user might choose their own route through the page, but the site has been designed to try and maintain their focused interest throughout the journey towards the end goal of completing the contact form and make an enquiry.

#### <em>Interaction Design</em>
### Skeleton
<!--How the information is presented - navagation to features -->
#### <em>Wireframes</em>
<!-- Add screen shot of wireframe here -->
All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.
My figma wireframes can be found here (link)

### Surface
<!--The look and feel of the site -colours, typography, ease of use -->
#### <em>Colour Scheme</em>
<!-- Add screen shot of color scheme here -->
