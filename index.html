                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>We offer a professional ‘Out of School Hours’ Service and Sports programme to
                    primary school children.
                </p>
                <p> Our afterschool and sports programme is built on having fun and play, ensuring that the atmosphere
                    is
                    different to that in a classroom.
                </p>
                <p> Our aim is to extend children’s daily learning by involving them in a
                    range of creative and sport programmes that will positively stimulate them physically, cognitively,
                    socially
                    and emotionally.

                <p>
                    Your child can unwind in a relaxed, safe and fun,
                    home from home environment which is part of the school community.
                    Our after school and sports model plays an important role in the social and emotional development
                    of children and is not intended to be an extension of the school day.
